Next.js has fully embraced server components, but understanding this new paradigm is a challenge for many developers. Determining when and where client-side vs. server-side code runs and its impact on performance has become utterly confusing.

Join this talk for an in-depth exploration of server components and HTML streaming, and their impact on performance. We’ll also cover how to mix server and client components effectively, as well as when and how to cache and revalidate your data. You’ll walk away with the knowledge to build performance applications using server components in Next.js.

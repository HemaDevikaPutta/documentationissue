The last 10 years in Web Development has brought a whirlwind of changes, acronyms, and contrasting opinions as “best practices” constantly evolve. It feels like we’ve been circling down Dante’s 9 Circles of Hell.

Join this talk as we compare and contrast the performance and user experience of different rendering strategies by taking one example and building it 9 different ways. Would it surprise you to know that today’s “best practices” look a lot like they did 10 years ago? As they say, “what’s old is new again”.
